# Attention with the Inception Architecture on the CIFAR-100 dataset

## Plan

1. Get the CIFAR-100 dataset
2. Implement the Inception v4 architecture
3. See initial results on the dataset
4. Examine the effects of data augmentation on the network

These are the steps to acquire a baseline of how well the network (or at least my implementation of it) performs.
As a next step I will add different types of attention to the network and see if the performance improves.



### Notes/Ideas

Try firsst with coarse CIFAR labels and then fine grained
